# Elemental-And
Sometimes in programming, it is necessary to perform an operator elementwise.
For the "AND" operator (&&) on two strings of 0 and 1 with the same length, elementally, we operate as follows.
The corresponding element in the answer string is equal to the "And" operator on the corresponding elements of the two input strings.

First, write a function that receives two characters (these characters are equal to 0 or 1) as input and returns the result of the "AND" operator as a boolean.
(Character 0 is equivalent to false and character 1 is equivalent to true.)

Then write a program that receives two equal length strings of 0 and 1 from the input and displays the result of the "AND" operator elementally on them.

Input:
Two strings of equal length consisting of 0 and 1

output:
The result of "AND" an element on two input strings
